# React - Nette framework API

- Complete setup of tools for communication within PHP Nette Framework based app and React/Webpack application with needed AJAX security (Request Authentication)

- Proxy pass for local development (query starts with api/ to distinguish local project files)

- Trying to effectively use Nette/Framework on backend (/server directory) as REST like service with as least components as possible

- Tracy is working and showing TracyBar and even error if it occurs

- /server is submodule git@github.com:sjiamnocna/nette-minimal.git

- Made for development on Linux as it's the best choice for developper

- On Windows, try use WSL2

Clone and get it running by running `yarn` and `cd server/; composer install`

Start both server and local React app (CRA) using `yarn start` in the main directory
